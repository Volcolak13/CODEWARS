#   Inspired by Square Every Digit (and by the inimitable myjinxin2015's many clever one-line kata), your goal
#   here is precisely the same (to square every digit in the given number), in 36 or fewer characters
#   (JavaScript), or 47 or fewer in Ruby
#
# (Note: in Ruby, spaces do not count towards your total-- within reason. Spacing shouldn't be more than 30%
# of your total to avoid possible cheats).
#
# Your return value should be in integer format.
#
# Your input will always be a valid, non-negative integer... no tricks!
#
# Bonus: Can you get it down to 34 characters? (43 in Ruby!)
#
# Note: Just as a head's up, numbers are > 2^31, so bitwise operators aren't viable.
